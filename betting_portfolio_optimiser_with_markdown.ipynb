    "# QUBO Portfolio Optimisation for a Single Football Match\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a **portfolio optimisation engine for sportsbook bets** using a QUBO / Ising formulation and the ORBIT probabilistic simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "(**TODO**: @EhsanMassah worth mentioning the provision of a tool for calculating correlations over a time-series of odds?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution focuses on **optimising a portfolio of sportsbook bets according to the user’s risk appetite**, rather than searching for strict risk-free arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each bet is treated as a **node** in a graph, with a weight equal to its **expected value (EV)** based on our probability estimate and the market odds.\n",
    "- **Edges** represent **correlation or overlap between bets** – for example, multiple bets depending on the same match outcome or scoreline.\n",
    "- The optimisation goal is to select a subset of bets that **maximises total positive alpha** while penalising portfolios that are **over-exposed to the same risks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we help a bettor (or trading desk) allocate their bankroll intelligently:  \n",
    "**focus on value, avoid redundant risk, and respect a chosen risk appetite.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we demonstrate the method on sports betting, the underlying optimisation framework is general.  \n",
    "Treating positions as nodes, their relationships as edges, and minimising an energy function to pick a portfolio can be applied in other financial settings too – for example **options selection**, **trades within the same asset class**, or **small diversified portfolios** where interactions matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO**: @EhsanMassah Similarly, the reverse problem, \"given a desired expected value, minimise the risk\", has applications in insurance...\n",

    "## Structure of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data preparation**  \n",
    "   - Load and clean a set of markets for a single football match.\n",
    "   - **TODO**: select which of the following bullet points is more accurate based on the data we decide to go with\n",
    "   - In this case we are re-using prior data that was sent from our API integration.\n",
    "   - In our case we are using a recent game between FC Barcelona and Atlético Madrid.\n",
    "   - Build a time series of odds and implied probabilities for multiple markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **QUBO formulation (portfolio objective)**  \n",
    "   - Compute the **expected value (EV)** of each bet.  \n",
    "   - Build a **QUBO energy function** where:  \n",
    "     - linear terms encode the value of including a discrete allocation of each bet;\n",
    "     - quadratic terms encode correlation / overlap penalties between bets. Deviations between the sum of the correlations and the user's risk appetite penalises the energy function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TODO**: @Asd2812 **Parameter Coefficient Estimation**\n",
    "   - **TODO**: Still to do, Orbit was crashing af for me so I couldn't run any proper simulations to get parameter coefficient estimation done.\n",
    "   - Given the objective coefficient, calculate the optimal penalty coefficient.\n",
    "   - Plot this against the efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Brute-force validation (small N)**  \n",
    "   - For a modest number of markets (e.g. N ≈ 20), exhaustively evaluate all 2^N portfolios.  \n",
    "   - Use this to obtain the exact ground state and validate the quality of ORBIT’s solution.\n",
    "   - Analysis of the brute-force algorithm reveals what we expected, a correct yet very slow answer.\n",
    "   - In a high-pace environment with a growing number of betting markets, waiting minutes to get the outcome of a small number of markets is far from optimal.\n",
    "   - **TODO** Check if this is the right place to post results or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **QUBO → Ising mapping and ORBIT optimisation**  \n",
    "   - Map the QUBO to an Ising model with couplings J and fields h.  \n",
    "   - Run the ORBIT simulator to approximately minimise the Ising energy.  \n",
    "   - Decode the resulting spin configuration back into a set of bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Comparison and interpretation**  \n",
    "   - Multiple classical solutions exist, with two of the more famous ones being simulated annealing and greedy algorithms.\n",
    "   - Both of these heuristic models have their pros and cons.\n",
    "   - Greedy algorithms reach sub-second speeds yet never get fall in the top 15% of most optimised portfolios.\n",
    "   - Simulated annealing find the optimal betting pattern at comparable speeds to that of probabilistic computing.\n",
    "   - However it cannot handle the actual size of sports betting markets, as handling simply over 50 markets causes the algorithm to run extremely slowly.\n",
    "   - **TODO**: Compare ORBIT’s solution to classical alternatives. We can use the results from the simulation done prior to tonight/this morning.\n",
    "   - **TODO**: (continuation of the same TODO.) If so, then the results are similar in time and accuracy, but Orbit performs better at scale, hence the advantage.\n",
    "   - Inspect the selected bets, the number of positions, and the implied “quality” of the portfolio. **TODO**: Plot on the efficient frontier. Decide if this is needed or not for the notebook code\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis is not on speed or large-scale deployment in this notebook, but on a **clear, end-to-end demonstration** of how a realistic optimisation problem is encoded as a QUBO and solved using probabilistic computing."

    "## Summary and typical usage\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built a realistic **sportsbook portfolio optimisation** instance for a single football match.  \n",
    "- Encoded the problem as a **QUBO** where:\n",
    "  - linear terms reward high expected value bets,  \n",
    "  - quadratic terms penalise correlated / overlapping exposures.  \n",
    "- Exhaustively searched all \\(2^N\\) portfolios for a modest-sized universe (N ≈ 20) to obtain the **exact ground state**.\n",
    "- Mapped the QUBO to an **Ising model** and used **ORBIT** to approximately minimise the Ising energy.\n",
    "- Compared the ORBIT solution to the brute-force optimum and inspected the selected portfolio of bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a typical user with more compute, the same pipeline can be applied to **larger sets of markets**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data feed would come from live sportsbook APIs rather than static files.  \n",
    "- The correlation structure \\(Q\\) can incorporate more sophisticated measures of dependence between markets.  \n",
    "- ORBIT can be used to explore the energy landscape and propose **high-quality portfolios** within the user’s risk and bankroll constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is therefore intended as an **end-to-end, validated proof of concept** that a real combinatorial portfolio problem in sports betting can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulated as a QUBO,\n",
    "2. Mapped to an Ising model, and\n",
    "3. Solved using probabilistic computing techniques such as ORBIT.\n"
